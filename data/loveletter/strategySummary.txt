Winning the game requires obtaining a specific number of tokens, depending on the number of players. Strategic gameplay involves optimizing the use of character cards. For instance, discard Princess Annette to have her carry your letter, but avoid doing so if you already have a letter in your hand. Other character cards, like Countess Wilhelmina and King Arnaud IV, have unique effects when discarded, such as forcing a trade of cards or making another player discard their hand and draw new ones.

To improve your chances of winning, make use of the following character cards strategically:

1. Prince Arnaud: Force other players to discard their cards and draw new ones. This is especially useful for disrupting opponents' strategies.
2. Handmaid Susannah: Protect yourself from other players' effects. This card can help you maintain your hand and avoid losing valuable cards.
3. Baron Talus: Knock out other players with lower-ranked cards. This is an aggressive move that can help you eliminate opponents and obtain tokens.
4. Priest Tomas: Gather information about other players' hands. This card allows you to make more informed decisions and plan your moves accordingly.
5. Guard Odette: Knock out players who have specific cards. This can be used to target opponents who possess cards that pose a threat to your strategy.

By employing these strategies and making the most of your character cards, you can increase your chances of winning the game. Remember to adapt your strategy based on the number of players and the cards you have in your hand, as well as the actions of your opponents.
