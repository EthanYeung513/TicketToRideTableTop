Love Letter is a game of strategy and deduction in which players aim to have their suitor deliver a love letter to the princess. Each player holds a secret card, and the objective is to be the last player standing or have the highest-ranking card at the end of each round. To win the game, a player must earn a certain number of tokens based on the number of players.

To play the game well, players must carefully choose which card to discard on their turn, taking into account both its effect and its value. For example, discarding a high-value card may seem like a good idea, but it can also make a player vulnerable to being knocked out by other players. Conversely, discarding a low-value card may protect a player from being knocked out, but it may also limit their chances of winning the round.

Players can use the abilities of certain cards to their advantage. For example, discarding Princess Annette forces all other players to discard their cards and draw new ones. If a player is holding Princess Annette when another player discards her, they are knocked out of the round. Countess Wilhelmina allows a player to trade hands with another player, while King Arnaud IV allows a player to guess another player's card. If correct, the guesser takes the other player's card, while if incorrect, the guesser is knocked out of the round.

Prince Arnaud is a powerful card that can force other players to discard their hands and draw new ones. This can be especially useful if a player suspects that another player has a high-value card. Handmaid Susannah is a defensive card that protects a player from other players' effects. Baron Talus allows a player to compare hands with another player and potentially knock them out of the round. Priest Tomas allows a player to gain information about other players' hands, while Guard Odette allows a player to guess another player's card and potentially knock them out of the round.

To win the game, players must be strategic in their card choices and pay close attention to the cards that other players have discarded. By using the abilities of certain cards to their advantage and making informed decisions about which cards to discard, players can increase their chances of winning the game. Ultimately, the key to success in Love Letter is to stay one step ahead of the competition and be willing to take calculated risks in order to achieve victory.
