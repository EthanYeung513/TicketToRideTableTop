Love Letter is a card game where players hold a secret card representing their current suitor trying to deliver a love letter to the princess. The game includes 16 unique cards with different ranks and effects. Players draw and discard cards to manipulate the order of suitors closest to the princess. The round ends when the deck is empty or all players but one are eliminated. The player closest to the princess wins a token of affection, and the first player to collect a certain number of tokens based on the number of players wins the game.

Each card has a unique effect when discarded, such as forcing a player to discard their hand, trading cards with another player, or comparing hands and knocking out the lower rank. Some cards also have ongoing effects while in a player's hand, such as immunity to other cards' effects. Additionally, discarding Princess Annette will eliminate a player if they have a letter in their hand, while having Countess Wilhelmina in hand with either the King or Prince forces the player to discard the Countess.

Players can look at one other player's hand without revealing it to everyone, and the Guard card allows a player to name a card and knock out another player if they have that card, unless all remaining players are protected by the Handmaid. Overall, Love Letter is a game of strategy and luck, where players must use their cards' effects to their advantage and anticipate their opponents' moves to win the princess's favor.
