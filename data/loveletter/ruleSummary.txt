Love Letter is a card game in which players hold secret cards representing characters carrying love letters to Princess Annette. The goal is to have the character closest to her at the end of each round. The game includes 16 unique cards, reference cards, and affection tokens.

To win, players must collect a certain number of tokens based on the number of players. Each round, players take turns drawing a card and discarding one, applying its effect even if it's detrimental. The effects of the cards vary based on their rank and include actions such as discarding another player's hand, making oneself immune to other cards' effects, initiating a comparison of hands to knock out another player, secretly viewing another player's hand, and naming a card to knock out another player if they have that card.

The game emphasizes honesty and discourages cheating. If the deck is empty or all but one player is eliminated, the round ends, and the player closest to Princess Annette in rank wins a token of affection. The game is won by collecting the required number of tokens, which are 7 tokens for 2 players, 5 tokens for 3 players, and 4 tokens for 4 players.

Characters from the Tempest line, including Princess Annette, Countess Wilhelmina, King Arnaud IV, and Prince Arnaud, are featured in the game. Each character has unique abilities that affect gameplay when discarded or held in a player's hand. Players can look at one other player's hand without revealing it to everyone, and the "Guard" card allows a player to name a card other than "Guard" and knock out another player if they have that card, unless all other players are protected by the "Handmaid" card.
