You are playing the card game Love Letter. Your job is to write the evaluation logic to help an AI play this game. Don't leave parts unfinished or TODOs.
First, write a java class called LoveLetterEvaluator class, with only a single function with this signature:
 - public double evaluateState(LoveLetterGameState gameState, int playerId)
This is a heuristic function to play Love Letter. The variable gameState is the current state of the game, and playerId
is the ID of the player we evaluate the state for. Write the contents of this function, so that we give a higher numeric
evaluation to those game states that are beneficial to the player with the received playerId as id. Return:
  - 0.0 if player playerId lost the game.
  - 1.0 if player playerId won the game.
 If the game is not over, return a value between 0.0 and 1.0 so that the value is close to 0.0 if player playerId is close to losing,
 and closer to 1.0 if playerId is about to win the game.
Take into account the whole board position, checking for lines that are about to be completed, and possible opponent moves.
You can use the following API:
 - In LoveLetterGameState, you can use the following functions:
    - double getGameScore(int id), to return the score of the id player passed as a parameter.
    - int getRemainingCards(), to get number of remaining cards in the draw deck.
    - PartialObservableDeck<LoveLetterCard> getPlayerHandCards(int id), returns the cards in hand of player id. If this id is not playerId, these cards will not be necessarily real.
    - boolean getWinner(), returns the Id of the player that won the game, or -1 if the game is not over.
    - int getCurrentPlayer(), returns the Id of the player that moves next.
 - LoveLetterCard represents a card in the game. For a LoveLetterCard card, you can use:
   - card.cardText, a String with the name of the card.
   - card.value, an int with the value of the card.
Assume all the other classes are implemented, and do not include a main function. Add all the import statements required,
in addition to importing games.loveletter.cards.LoveLetterCard, games.loveletter.LoveLetterGameState, core.components.PartialObservableDeck
