Tic Tac Toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
