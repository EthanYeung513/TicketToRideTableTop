 Brief description of the game Virus is a card game where players compete to be the first to get a healthy human body (four organ cards) by overcoming the traps of rivals who will do their best to infect, destroy or steal each other’s organs. A very fun game with lots of interaction between players.  How to play “Virus” Things you need to know before starting to play  Number of players Virus is a game for 2 to 6 players, from 8 years old.  What do you need to play Virus is a commercial card game, so you’ll need to buy it or borrow it from your neighbor, a friend, your sister… Just make sure to return it in perfect condition ;-)  Discover the VIRUS deck The cards in the VIRUS deck are special cards designed specifically for this game. We briefly introduce them below and then explain in more detail the role played by each one of them.  ORGAN CARDS  There are 21 organ cards. They are distinguished by the heart-shaped icon in the corners. There are 5 organ cards of each color —red, green, blue and yellow— and one multicolor organ card. Organ cards are key to winning a game of Virus. Four healthy organ cards of different colors are needed to complete a healthy body and win the game. The multicolor organ is an advantage. Then we explain which one.  VIRUS CARDS  There are 17 virus cards. The icon in the corners that distinguishes them from the other cards symbolizes a virus, although seeing the drawing in the center of each card it is difficult to confuse a virus card with any other type of card. The viruses are perfectly distinguishable, illustrated in a very clear and amusing way. There are 4 virus cards of each color —red, green, blue and yellow— and one multicolor virus card. They are used to hinder the advance of opposing players. How? Destroying any of your organs or medicines. They are one of the essence of the game.  MEDICINE CARDS  There are 20 medicine cards. The icon is a pill. There are 5 medicine cards of each color —red, green, blue and yellow— and four multicolored medicine cards. These are cards that play the opposite role to virus cards. They are used to protect organs allowing for healing, vaccination and immunization. With the cards presented so far we can already get an idea of how the game goes: we have to create a body with four organs, the medicine cards help to “build” and the virus cards to “destroy”. It looks like we already have game. But there is more. The best is yet to come. The treatment cards.  TREATMENT CARDS  There are 10 treatme

colored medicine cards. These are cards that play the opposite role to virus cards. They are used to protect organs allowing for healing, vaccination and immunization. With the cards presented so far we can already get an idea of how the game goes: we have to create a body with four organs, the medicine cards help to “build” and the virus cards to “destroy”. It looks like we already have game. But there is more. The best is yet to come. The treatment cards.  TREATMENT CARDS  There are 10 treatment cards, divided into 5 different categories. Later, we’ll explain the role each of them plays. For now, just know that these cards are a real threat because they can completely change the game with just one play! Goal of the game  How do you win a game of VIRUS The objective of Virus is to create a healthy body by getting 4 cards of healthy organs of 4 different colors. Rules of VIRUS: This is How a Game Goes  Dealing the Cards The deck of cards is shuffled and three cards are dealt to each player. The rest of the deck is left face down in the center of the table.  Who’s first? The first turn goes to the player who has shuffled and dealt the cards. In each game —because you will not be able to play a single game — a different player will do it.  This is a Turn in VIRUS The player whose turn it is may use the cards in his hand to perform one of these two actions: 1. Play one of your cards. 2. Discard cards in the discard pile, which will be created with the cards face up next to the deck of cards. As there are 4 types of cards in total you have 5 possibilities which we explain in detail below.  OPTION 1 – PLAY AN ORGAN CARD You can use an organ card to create one organ out of the four you need to win, leaving that card on the table and in front of him keeping in mind that: • Two organs of the same color cannot be created. • You cannot have more than four organs in total, unless the fifth is the multicolor organ. That is the only role played by the multicolored organ. Whoever is lucky enough to have it has a better chance of getting the four healthy organs before the others.  OPTION 2 – PLAY A VIRUS CARD You can use a virus card to mess with another player by affecting one of their organs that matches the color of the virus card you’re using. • When a virus card is left on a free organ – which has no card on it – it becomes infected and is no longer considered a healthy organ. • If the organ already has a virus card on it and we add a second one then the organ is de

OPTION 3 – PLAY A MEDICINE CARD You can use a medicine card to protect your organs in different ways: • If one of your organs is infected with a virus card, the medicine card removes the virus by passing both cards to the discard pile. • If we leave the medicine card on a free organ, it is protected against the very likely attack of a virus. • If the organ is already protected with a medicine card and we add a second medicine card that organ will be immunized against possible attacks of any kind. This organ is already saved. Masterful play!  ABOUT MULTICOLOR CARDS The multicolor cards act as if they were of any of the colors both for the good —we can use the multicolor virus to infect a red organ, for example— and for the bad —if we have protected an organ with the multicolor medicine, any virus card, whatever color it is, will destroy that medicine—.  OPTION 4 – PLAY A TREATMENT/ACTION CARD These cards can turn the game situation completely upside down. They are very powerful cards. Next, we’ll explain the effect of each one, but first, a clarification: the treatment card played must be placed in the discard pile.
